As a formative presentation, Emily Cloete, Torie Eden and Tom Hackshaw collaborated on this live performance. It involved the performers stripping naked and painting one another in grey paint inside _The Lab_. Peep holes were cut out in the walls of the structure to allow the staff to look through and mark the performance. As this takes place, the performers also talk amongst one another and make jokes about each individual staff member and Elam as a whole.
