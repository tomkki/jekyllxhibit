Filmed at 5:45 AM every morning, Tom Hackshaw would perform a series of morning rituals to get himself into a state of art-making. These rituals were blowing a balloon, inhaling, lighting a match, saying "checkmate", painting the Japanese flag, painting a line on the wall, and playing a move of chess.
