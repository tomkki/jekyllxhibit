Torie Eden joined Emily and myself for the formative presentation in a live collaborative painting performance. We stood in the space, naked, and painted one another grey whilst cracking jokes about the Elam teaching staff. The Lab was a completely closed space except for a few “peep-holes”, which the staff could look through and mark our work.

This performance unfolded over the course of close to three hours. There was very little staff interaction or viewing, staying intially for approximately 5 minutes and then leaving.
<br><br>
Ultimately, the performance was not as successful as it could have been; we were unprepared and lacked the confidence to truly poke fun at the members of the staff. This, on top of the fact that it was practically very difficult to view our performance hindered the potential of the work.

It was still a valuable learning experience, and had some interesting concepts relating to power dynamics and spaces. We had created a space within a space that was seperate from everything else and was under our occupation. We tried not to care about what was happening outside of it - and this could be considered “the art trick”.
