Masks was created shortly after the _Grey Performance_, and took place inside _The Lab_ (see research booklet). It was part of the same series of performances done by Emily Cloete and myself which included _Soapstealer_.

Borrowing from the ideas and work of Paul McCarthy, Emily and myself individually responded to the idea of the mask differently. 
<br><br>
In my case, I combined yoghurt, tuna, WeetÂ­ Bix, ketchup and banana to create a material for mask making. This material was applied to my entire face until there was very little visible skin, then taped down to create a mask. Once taped, I could no longer see, hear, smell or breathe.

The work could have been more successful had I performed slightly more convincingly. In performing for the camera my actions naturally became more agitated and rushed, breaking a sense of rhythm within the work. However, it was still an interesting exploration into the work of Paul McCarthy, and brought the nature of the space within _The Lab_ into consideration.
