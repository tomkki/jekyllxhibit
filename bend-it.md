An ongoing project started in the second to last week of the project, _Bend It_ is a series of videos performed with Emily Cloete. Every Monday night, we dress in suits and film ourselves dancing to the song _Bend It_ by Dave Dee, Dozy, Mick and Tich. The song itself is under 3 minutes long, but is kept on loop to allow each dance session to last for an hour.

_Bend It_ was inspired by Gilbert & George, who has a work of the same name. In their version, the video lasts the duration of the song, and the dancing itself is carefree and easy. In our case, the long duration of each session and the routine parameters behind it makes what was once a humorous work into a gruelling, physical “chore” that tests our endurance.

In continuing this series, we believe that the videos themselves will begin to show a kind of evolution. Our own personalities and characteristics become greatly visible when we dance, and it is a way of visually illustrating the nature of our relationship. My movements are stiff and rigid in comparison to Emily, whose posture is a lot more relaxed.
