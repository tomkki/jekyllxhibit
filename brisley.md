This work took place the week after the _Painting Show_ (see research booklet). Filmed in my garage, I used different acrylic colour paints to paint an inverted self-portrait of myself.
<br><br>
Whereas in the past I had been projecting, painting portraits of myself and my friends onto a material surface, I wanted to reverse this notion. Essays by Amelia Jones on the Working of the Flesh and the body as a surface were strong drivers to this work.
<br><br>
Amelia Jones describes the most fundamental part of the human body being the skin, the surface of the body. I threw away the canvases and boards, opting to using my own body as a site for painting.
<br><br>
The work was strongly inspired by Stuart Brisley, who has made several works treating the face as a surface, reversing the notion of the self-portrait.
