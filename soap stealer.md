Made the day after _Masks_, _Soapstealer_ was part of a series of performances done by Emily Cloete and myself that aimed to be quick, fluid and relatively simple. Based off an existing work by Campbell Patterson, we both responded to the original differently and created our own versions accordingly.
<br><br>
_Soapstealer_ was filmed in the level 4 Mondrian building toilets at the Elam School of Fine Arts, where the original was filmed. It involved stripping half naked and attempting to push out all of the hand­dispenser soap onto my face, whereas Patterson’s was into an ice cream container.
<br><br>
The work engaged in the same conversations set by Patterson in regards to architecture. He likened the gesture of pushing out soap to “wanking off the building”, and through pushing it onto my face this notion is extended further.
<br><br>
After 4 minutes my eyes could no longer bear the stinging of the soap and I switched to washing everything off in the sink. While this was not intended, it added an additional element to the performance that was by complete chance.
