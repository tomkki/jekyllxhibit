title: Smear (draft)

An investigation into the work of Mike Kelley lead to the creation of two video works, both titled _Smear_. A video camera was set up on a tripod behind a pane of glass, and I then proceeded to lick and smear my face across the surface of the glass. This continued until the remnants of my spit formed a pattern on the surface.

Both works deal with the surface of the screen as a key driver. The intention was to create the illusion of me trying to emerge out of the television, quietly licking behind the screen and observing the viewer from behind the glass.

As these videos were rushed and treated as drafts they could not really be considered as anything more. However, it was a valuable experience and shift from _Pictures of friends_ (see research booklet), trying to find non­representational methods of “painting” while also creating a conversation with the “grandparents” of contemporary art.
