This video was a concept that was never truly realised due to time constraints. Inspired by various artist documentaries available on YouTube such as TateShots and Guggenheim Video, I attempted to mimic the style of these presentations into a work about myself. The thought of me dressed as a curator, talking about myself in the third-person made me laugh.

It could be argued that this video has loose connection to our interest in performing for the camera. This was created three weeks before we began shooting photographs such as Cunt and Shit, so while the work itself was never properly realised it helped to inform later works that we created.

Artists such as Martin Kippenberger did a lot of their own writing and promotion, so making a “YouTube style” documentary about myself could be considered a similar yet more modern approach.
