title: Singing Jon Bywater

This was an exercise that involved me singing an excerpt from Jon Bywater’s review of the 20th Biennale of Sydney. I sang it in the tune of Adele’s _Hello_, completely improvised.

The idea came from watching a video by John Baldessari singing Sol Lewitt’s _20 sentences for conceptual art_. Baldessari’s voice is quite monotonous and boring, and I saw it as a parallel to my own voice. To try and turn something dry and boring into a work of art was the goal I had set.
