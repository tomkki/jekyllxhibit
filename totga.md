Made in the first week of the project, _The One That Got Away_ was a two-hour performance by Emily Cloete and myself. The work involved us sitting with a pair of fishing rods overlooking a grassy field, trying to catch fish as the sun went down.

To describe the video in a nutshell, it is very minimal with little movement or action. At times it appears like a still image, one that grows more orange and then dims as the sun falls. We donâ€™t talk to each other at all during the video, reeling in our lines every now and again.

_The One That Got Away_ was spontaneous in its inception and creation, and was largely an experiment rather than a finished work. It was created during a period where Emily and myself maintained our own individual projects, but also held interests in making work collaboratively.
