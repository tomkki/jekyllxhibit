Continuing with my nonsensical and banal approach to videoed performances, Sarariman involves me playing the role of the stereotypical Japanese salaryman. Using a packet of Spaceman candy sticks as a prop, I pretend to smoke an entire box of cigarettes and reflect on “the middle­management working life”.

The idea emerged from the practice of artists such as Makoto Aida, who often makes work that makes a joke out of the typical Japanese “sarariman” stereotype. Sarariman could be considered an early exploration into performing for the camera
<br><br>
The video lacked entertainment as my actions were minimal, scrunching my face as though I was stressed and sighing at random intervals. As I would reach the end of the “cigarette” I pretended to stub it out, then proceeded to eat the butt and “light” another one.

Spaceman candy sticks have a cultural significance to New Zealand childhood, and I was trying to draw from this memory as well. In some ways my performitivity goes that far back, before a camera was even present.
