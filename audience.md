In continuing my investigation into Western performance art history, _The Audience_ is an attempt to re-enact Vito Acconci’s _Centers_. The original work was of particular interest to me at the time, as Acconci talks about it in relation to the “fishbowl space of the television”. In my mind, this was what Smear was trying to achieve.

Filmed in my bedroom, _The Audience_ was an attempt to point at the camera for as long as possible whilst also trying to mentally visualise an audience looking at my work. The response from the _Painting Show_ (see research booklet) left me nervous about any critical feedback from an audience, and this work was treated as a way of picturing this.

After a few minutes of pointing, the camera shifts from focusing on my face to focusing on the tip of my finger. I appear further away, and the micro-expressions and twitches of pain become blurred.

The dialogue with prominent figures in art history continued to function as a key driver to works such as _The Audience_. In following a pedigree set out by these artists I hoped it would help establish my own artistic language, and form some understanding as to why I enjoyed these works in the first place.
