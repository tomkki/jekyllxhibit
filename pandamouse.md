Continuing our investigation into Western art history, we became drawn to the work of Fischli & Weiss. Their simple, “anti-art” approach to creativity and the everyday was particularly inspiring. Working within the realm of art, they could frame and draw attention to something we would otherwise overlook.
<br><br>
Drawing inspiration from their _Rat and Bear_ videos, Emily Cloete and myself hired panda and mouse costumes. We sought to film ourselves in our immediate environments but try to create a visual spectacle through wearing the costumes.
<br><br>
Over the course of a week, we attended the Elam Prize Giving night, went to gallery openings, went to a beach, bought ice cream and walked around town in these costumes. Our actions were no different from what we normally do in our everyday lives. However, wearing costumes allowed us to be anonymous, and begin acting the role of the panda and the mouse.
<br><br>
Compared to the source domain, the videos we created contrast starkly to that of Fischli & Weiss. Ironically, our own individual personalities shine through despite the costumes, and this begins to speak to the animal characters themselves. We were not performing under the mindset of Fishily & Weiss, but of Emily & Tom.
<br><br>
The costumes made our actions theatrical, even if nothing we did together was planned or choreographed. It also gave us a sense of confidence through the anonymity to be “confrontational” in public spaces.
<br><br>
Interestingly, we had security called on us several times, despite not doing anything outright wrong. These costumes and the anonymity they possessed did not break any civil laws, but arguably tested the social laws of some people. The distinction between public and private space became unclear wherever we went and performed.
