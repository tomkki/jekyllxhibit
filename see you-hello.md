From February 2nd – June 2nd, I took a video of myself waving goodbye to my parents every morning, and another one in the afternoon when I came home from school. 
<br><br>
Each video is short, sometimes showing my parents waving me off/greeting me in and other times just their voices in the background. There are 182 videos in total.
<br><br>
This exercise was considered a ritual, one that became a part of my everyday routine and helped me get into the mindset of creating art before I arrived at Elam. I also wished to make something that included my family members, as they have and always will be integral to my creative process.
<br><br>
These videos functioned in a similar manner to my _Sincerely, Tom Hackshaw_ postcards. The documentation of my departure and arrival is something linked with Japanese culture, where it is a part of everyday life to announce these things. It is simply framing something that is a part of everyday life and moving it into an artistic space.
<br><br>
Despite the large number of videos, I was never able to fully realise a work out of this documentation. While it was governed by a set of instructions and became a routine action, I was unable to see it beyond what it literally was; videos documenting the same thing every day.
