Since February 29th I have been undertaking a series of morning rituals every morning. These rituals are very loosely based on the practices of a variety of artists, including On Kawara, Piero Manzoni, Marcel Duchamp, Marina Abramovic, Yoko Ono, Sol Lewitt and Jiro Yoshihara. The rituals themselves involved waking up at 5:45 AM, writing a postcard to myself in the future, blow a balloon, inhale, light and blow out a match, say “checkmate”, paint a Japanese hinomaru flag, paint a line on the wall, and play a single turn of chess against myself.

The purpose of these rituals were to put myself into a state of mind that allowed me to think about art and be in the zone for making before the day has even begun. Therefore, these rituals couldn’t really be considered works in themselves, as they are just simple routine gestures that have been carried out every morning. Because of this, I never had any intention of presenting these rituals from the onset; this is just background noise. However, the hope was that they help to facilitate the creation of other art.

Lewitt stressed the importance of having rules in any conceptual artwork, and The Rising Son carries itself from a set of parameters. All rituals are documented and filmed, performed in the same order, every day of every week until June 2nd. The routine aspect also spoke to me about Japanese culture, where morning exercises are part of many peoples everyday lives. Hence the title is a nod to my own cultural heritage, looking towards the “rising sun” every morning.
