One of the rituals that I have performed every morning since February 29th is writing myself a postcard. The postcards are handmade, addressed to me but also written by me. On my way to school I would post the postcards and wait for them to arrive in the mail 3 – 4 days later.
<br><br>
The postcards were strongly inspired by On Kawara’s _I Got Up_ series. While Kawara sent the postcards to friends and family from around the world, the gesture of writing to myself in the future, then receiving something from my past a few days later interested me greatly. The content of the postcards are mostly sentimental in nature, reflecting on what has happened, what is to come, how I feel, people I am thinking of, etcetera.
<br><br>
From Week 10 onwards, I was unable to buy any new stamps due to financial constraints. Because of this I drew a box where the stamp would normally go, and left the postcard in my mailbox for 3 days. After the third day I would collect the postcards again and pretend I had received them via the post as normal.

Writing every morning served a number of purposes. It allowed me to formulate my thoughts as soon as I got up, and would often make me think about someone other than myself. It also functioned as a record keeping device, in a similar sense to a diary or research book but simplified like a poem.
