title: Lifting my brother for as long as I can

This was an ongoing series where I would film myself holding my brother for as long as I could. Done once a week, the durations of each attempt would vary depending on how tired I was, and whether or not I was getting any stronger.

The work was based off of Campbell Patterson’s _Lifting My Mother for as Long as I Can_. I was drawn to the original for its simplicity and understanding of “mum being the ultimate object”. However, rather than using my mother I decided that my younger brother would be more interesting.

As Patterson notes, each version is different and there is a narrative between them. We have some similar facial features, and over time the appearance of my brother changes at a faster rate than I do. After a few weeks we began to treat this exercise as a routine chore.
