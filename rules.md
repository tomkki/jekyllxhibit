In exploring the dynamics of our working relationship, we decided to create an exercise that had a set of rules, and one with a material outcome. By doing this we hoped to create a sense of competition while learning to pick up on one another’s nuances.

The rules themselves were simple: someone goes first, they draw a character in a scenario that makes them the last person standing. Someone then must top what the last person drew and make their character the last person standing. You can be as imaginative or ridiculous as you like.

As the game progressed our ideas became more and more over-the-top. It became clear that a game like this showed the way in which we use each other as a foil to bounce ideas off of. Ultimately this game was a simple visual investigation into the nature of our partnership.

The title of the video is in loose reference to the 1939 French film _The Rules of the Game_ (La Règle du jeu). The work was fluid, fun and straightforward, encompassing all of the drivers that have been integral to our creative process.
